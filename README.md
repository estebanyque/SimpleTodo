SimpleTodo
==========

Simple Todo list written in Python.

Currently it is possible to test Task class from todo.py python script.

For the momment, only 4 fields are used by each task:
id: primary key
date: YYYY-MM-DD
desc: task description
alarm: a Y/N value, not implemented

other fields to add soon:
status: pending, overdue, done
priority: 1..5 to sort tasks

Next ideas:
 * a small shell to interact with each Task instance.
   * add, get, update and list tasks

 * use it from the web with Flask.
